            My old school name is Stabekk School. It is a great school because I had a lot of friends there and beautiful teachers.
            They helped me a lot in my study in both Norwegian and English languages. I hope that I can visit my old school again in
            the future and see all the staff there.

            During my time in high school, I had the opportunity to study two distinct subjects: science and literature.
            I found both physics and chemistry to be equally intriguing and enjoyable.

            My high school was not so big. It was only one floor with a few classes.<br>
            But the surrounding area was huge with so many delightful sceneries.<br>
            We could see a high hill with a river beside it through the window.
