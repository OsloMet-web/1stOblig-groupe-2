        <p>During my time in high school, 
            I had the opportunity to study two distinct subjects: science and literature. 
            I found both physics and chemistry to be equally intriguing and enjoyable.</p>

        <p title="I mean my school in Syria">My high school was not so big. It was only one floor with a few classes.<br>
          But the surrounding area was huge with so many delightful sceneries.<br>
         We could see a high hill with a river beside it through the window.</p>
